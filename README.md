# 🔐 Face Login AI – Secure Authentication with Facial Recognition

This is a simple AI-powered face login system built using Python, OpenCV, and the `face_recognition` library. It allows access only when the authorized user's face is recognized through a webcam.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time facial recognition using AI
- Webcam-based login authentication
- Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction
- Ideal for personal, educational, or prototype security systems

## 🎥 Demo

A short demo video is available as part of my submission for the **3MTT Knowledge Showcase Challenge (May 2025)**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- Streamlit

## 📁 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-login-ai
cd face-login-ai
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the App
```bash
